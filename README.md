## Version management: 
In this project, I use Git branches with a clear structure to separate different development task. Each assignment has its own branch, and when the work is complete the branch is merged into the live-DigitalOcean branch. Witch is used only for deployment. 

- Setup-inl√§mning-1: The first branch for the first assignment, in this project. In this branch the basic structure was created.

- Deploy-inl√§mning-2: The second branch for the second assignment, for this project. I added login and account creation functionality.

- Backend-inl√§mning-3: the third branch for the third assignment, for this project. In this branch i have created backend and connected the endpoints I created in the backend with frontend.

- Live-DigitalOcean: This branch i connected to the public version of the project deployed on DigitalOcean. It is only used for deployment, and it contains the same content as the branch Deploy-inl√§mning-2.

### This branch structure makes it easy because:
- Separates different assignments.
- Keeps production and development separated. 

## Build system:
This project uses **Vite** as the build system. Vite is configured to transpile and bundle the code for production when running. 

I decided to use **Vite** as the build system for this project because it makes it easy to get started with React. Additionally, when starting the project, I can choose whether to use JSX or TSX. For this project, I chose to use TSX because I wanted to practice with it, and I find it a bit easier than JSX because it allows you to see the type of each variable.

- To use the build system you can use: 
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
